# Quadratic Kenku Solver

The code in this repository houses the computational proofs and claims made in the paper [Cyclic isogenies of elliptic curves over a fixed quadratic field](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.08891).

In particular, users may generate their own determinations of cyclic isogenies, by going to the file `sage_code/quadratic_kenku_solver.py`, changing the `D_VALUES` list to the desired values, and running at the command line:

```
sage quadratic_kenku_solver.py
```
